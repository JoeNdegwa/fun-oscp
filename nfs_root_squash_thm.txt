What is root_squash?

By default, on NFS shares- Root Squashing is enabled, and prevents anyone connecting to the NFS share from having root access to the NFS volume. Remote root users are assigned a user “nfsnobody” when connected, which has the least local privileges. Not what we want. However, if this is turned off, it can allow the creation of SUID bit files, allowing a remote user root access to the connected system.

SUID
So, what are files with the SUID bit set? Essentially, this means that the file or files can be run with the permissions of the file(s) owner/group. In this case, as the super-user. We can leverage this to get a shell with these privileges!

### STEPS

NFS Access ->
Gain Low Privilege Shell ->
Upload Bash Executable to the NFS share ->
Set SUID Permissions Through NFS Due To Misconfigured Root Squash ->
Login through SSH ->
Execute SUID Bit Bash Executable ->
ROOT ACCESS
