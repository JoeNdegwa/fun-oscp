We visit the site and find it's a default apache installation. Checking the source code we see the below comment :
<!-- 'myapp' can be downloaded to analyze from here
     its running on port 1337 -->
On visiting the site on port 1337, we note the below response:
 12:22:01 up 13:49,  0 users,  load average: 0.00, 0.00, 0.00

What do you want me to echo back? GET /myapp HTTP/1.1
Searching a bit on Google, we realize this is an indicator to ROP buffer overflow.
We download the myapp as : wget http://10.10.10.147/myapp, check the file using strings and realize it might be C based application. Many functions in the app
suggests so. Running a file against it gives : "myapp: ELF 64-bit LSB executable, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked"

We make the app executable "chmod +x myapp" and run it ./myapp and we note it just echoes back what we send it.
What do you want me to echo back? echo
echo
We use python to generate a couple of A's and send it to the program to see if it crushes: "print("A"*150)"
A hundred and fifty A's crashes the app:
What do you want me to echo back? AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Segmentation fault

We need to now generate a pattern we can use gdb or msfpattern for this and then hereafter find the offset.
