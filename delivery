I start off with an nmap scan:
└─# nmap -sC -sV -A 10.10.10.222
PORT   STATE SERVICE VERSION
22/tcp open  ssh     OpenSSH 7.9p1 Debian 10+deb10u2 (protocol 2.0)
| ssh-hostkey:

80/tcp open  http    nginx 1.14.2
|_http-server-header: nginx/1.14.2
|_http-title: Welcome
And a full port scan reveals a third open port:
└─# nmap -p- --min-rate 10000 10.10.10.222
PORT     STATE SERVICE
22/tcp   open  ssh
80/tcp   open  http
8065/tcp open  unknown

Visiting the website on port 80, I note a redirect to http://helpdesk.delivery.htb/

Now we attempt to access port 8065 at http://10.10.10.222:8065/signup_email
